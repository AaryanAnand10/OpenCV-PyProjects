# 1 Real Time Smile Detection:-
Real-Time Smile Detection with OpenCV and Python: This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to create a real-time smile detection system using Haar cascade classifiers. By accessing the computer's webcam, the script captures video frames, converts them to grayscale, and employs pre-trained classifiers to identify faces and smiles. Rectangles are drawn around detected faces and smiles, providing visual feedback in the live video stream. The script offers a simple yet effective demonstration of computer vision capabilities, making it a great starting point for exploring facial feature detection applications.
